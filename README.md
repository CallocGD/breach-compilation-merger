# breach-complation-merger
Faster version of the breach-complation's old shell scripts written in python but will soon be written in either Rust or C++ if I have the time

## Why?
Let's face it 
- breach complation is old and the shell scripts it had are now 7 years old.
- the shell scripts call for too many proccesses at a time and when you have so many files this can be very slow.

## How to install
There's only one other python library we need called `click` luckily I made you a requirements.txt file

## TODOS
- I have plans to write more stuff in the future to our python version 
such as email lookup and a file splitter for when things become too full.
