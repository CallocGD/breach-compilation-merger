# breach-complation-merger
faster version of the breach-complation's shell scripts written in python but will soon be written in either Rust or C++


## Why?
Let's face it 
- breach complation is old and the shell scripts it had are now 7 years old.
- the shell scripts call for too many proccesses at a time and when you have so many files this can be very slow.
